# Amazon Customer Sentiment Dashboard

This project showcases an end-to-end sentiment analysis of Amazon product reviews using Python and Power BI. It highlights key insights into customer satisfaction through visual and textual data exploration.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, WordCloud)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI

## Project Overview

1. *Data Collection*  
   The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and contains thousands of Amazon customer reviews and ratings.

2. *Data Preparation*  
   Cleaned the dataset using Pandas by removing duplicates, null values, and irrelevant columns. Reviews were categorized into Positive, Neutral, and Negative based on their ratings.

3. *Text Processing & Word Cloud*  
   Created a word cloud to visualize the most common words for each sentiment group. Frequently used general terms like "Amazon", "this", and "you" were removed to improve clarity.

4. *Dashboard Design*  
   Built an interactive Power BI report to visualize:
   - Overall sentiment distribution
   - Word frequency per sentiment
   - Total number of reviews and average ratings

## Goal

This project is part of my data analytics portfolio and demonstrates my skills in data cleaning, text analysis, and interactive dashboard development.
